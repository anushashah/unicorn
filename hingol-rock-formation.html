            <h1><span>R</span>ock Formation</h1>
            <p>The University of Geneva and the University of Tehran conducted a joint study on the attractive features
                of this coastal strip of Iran and Balochistan, in which 36 rock formations were observed. According to
                this research, the effective process of erosion and sedimentation has played an important role in the
                erosion of rocks here for centuries, in which the waves of the sea carry with them a lot of soil and
                other substances to the shore. Layers of soil 1 to 10 meters and in many places even thicker were
                observed on these rocks of different heights, which gradually increased from the beach. The tidal waves
                of the sea and the strong stormy winds have carved the Makran coastal strip and the adjoining mountain
                cliffs in such a way that at first glance the area resembles a bizarre archaeological complex preserving
                the remains of some ancient civilization. The most famous of these rocks are the Princess of Hope and
                the Sphinx.<br><br>The most spectacular landform of Hangul National Park is a hoodoo called the Princess
                of Hope. Seen from afar, it resembles a gargantuan statue of a tall woman looking for something on the
                distant horizon. When the famous Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie came to Pakistan on a UN goodwill
                mission in 2004, this rock formation caught her attention and inspired her to name it <b>'Princess of
                    Hope'</b>. Despite its statuesque appearance, however, the pinnacle owes its form purely to ocean
                winds and other natural forces of erosion.<br><br>The <b>Balochistan Sphinx,</b> also known as the "Lion
                of Balochistan" or Abul-Hol, is a natural rock structure that bears resemblance to a sphinx and is
                visible from the Buzi Pass section of the Makran Coastal Highway.<br><br><b>Mud volcanoes</b>Hingol mud
                volcano ranging in height from 800 to 1500 feet are abundant in Hangul National Park, mostly in the
                Mid-Hor area. According to Muhammad Hanif Bhatti, a well-known traveler from Karachi, when he first saw
                the Chandra Gupta mudflat in Hangul National Park in 2010 he was amazed by the beauty and uniqueness of
                this natural process. At the time, the volcano was difficult to reach, but since the completion of the
                highway, visitors to the mud volcanoes have increased significantly. </p>

                    <p class="para1">The Princess of Hope is made of wind-eroded sedimentary rocks, and its formation is
                        attributed to the natural forces of erosion over thousands of years. The site has gained
                        cultural and geological significance, drawing visitors who are fascinated by the beauty of the
                        natural sculpture.<br><br>

                        Visitors to Hingol National Park can explore the diverse flora and fauna of the region,
                        including various species of plants, birds, and mammals. The park is home to a variety of
                        wildlife, such as leopards, ibex, and a range of bird species.<br><br>

                        It's advisable to check for any updates or changes to the park's status, accessibility, or
                        additional attractions, as this information may have evolved since my last update in January
                        2022.</p>
