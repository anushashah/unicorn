                        striking spiral horns that can grow to 5 feet long in mature males; female horns are smaller,
                        around 2 feet. The markhor's coat is reddish gray with a dark stripe running the length of its
                        back.<br><br>The markhor stands about 95–102 cm (37–40 inches) at the shoulder and has long (up
                        to 160 cm [63 inches]) corkscrew-shaped horns. Its coat is reddish brown in summer and long,
                        gray, and silky in winter. The male has a long, heavy fringe on its throat and chest.

                        28 inches at the shoulder with a general range of 17.5 to 30.5 inches high at the
                        shoulder.<br><br>The common leopards are the largest predators of its ecosystem and they play an
                        important role in maintaining its health. They keep a control on the population of herbivores
                        and remove the unhealthy animals from its habitat.</p>

                        below, with a black stripe down the sides of its neck. In flight, the long wings show large
                        areas of black and brown on the flight feathers.<br><br>Breeding populations are found in the
                        remote areas of Baluchistan province including Nag Valley, Chagai, Panjgan and Kharan (6). These
                        birds migrate to Sindh and Punjab to spend their winter. </p>

                        wingspan. In the nominate race the males weigh 6.2 to 10.5 kg (14 to 23 lb) and females
                        typically weigh 6.5 to 10.5 kg (14 to 23 lb), while in the Indian subspecies (G. f. fulvescens),
                        the vultures average 7.1 kg (16 lb).<br><br>Rüppell's griffon vultures have been documented as
                        having reached heights of over 36,000 feet (10,973 meters) above sea level. ...
                        The adaptation that allows this species to fly so high is an alteration of one of its proteins,
                        which allows the bird to fly efficiently despite lower pressure and available oxygen.</p>
